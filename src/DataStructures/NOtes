omega - Ω -> best
theta - θ -> average
Big O - O -> worst case


drop constants
to simple big O we drop constants
example n,2n, 3n will we use O(n) only

dropping non-dominants
example n²+n here ignore n now it looks like n²

o(1) -> examples n+n;
o(2) -> examples n+n+n will be treated as o(1)

0(logn) -> divide and conquer
